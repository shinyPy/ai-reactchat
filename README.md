# OpenAI React Chat Web Application
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
This project provides a web frontend for the OpenAI chat API. This project is for developers or advanced users that are familiar with [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) but want to customize the web interface.

Hosted and edited to use localStorage api keys instead of env if you're too lazy to run it on your computer
also currently using [oxyapi](https://app.oxyapi.uk/)

### Future plan
* Support custom headers and endpoints (already done with endpoints)
* Dynamic model selection 




## Goals
* Provide the same features as [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
[OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat).
* Use a modern web stack of React, Tailwind CSS, and Typescript.

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for details.
